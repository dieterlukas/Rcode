# Rcode

In this folder, I keep copies of various R code files that I am using for my analyses. They are commented, but please contact me if you have any questions (dieter.lukas@gmail.com).


*** List of projects ***

1. Cleaning pedigree datasets: code to check pedigree input files (files that list the parents of individuals) for potential errors (https://github.com/dieterlukas/Rcode/blob/master/Files/CleaningPedigreeDatasets.r)

2. Convert Pedigree File to Kin Per Individual: code that takes a cleaned pedigree file (files that list parents of individuals) and calculates for all dyads whether they are close kin (parent-offspring, siblings, etc.) (https://github.com/dieterlukas/Rcode/blob/master/Files/ConvertPedigreeFiletoKinPerIndividual.R)
